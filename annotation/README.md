Assignment: Annotation

I have correctly implemented the lyrics on the screen underneath the video.
I have included style.css that formats the font, alignment, and background
color of the video.

I collaborated with Gen Silverman, who directed me to the rainbow example
which was extremely useful.

I spent approximately 3 hours on this lab.

I forgot to commit as I went along, sorry about that.
