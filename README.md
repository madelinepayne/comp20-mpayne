What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
- This holds most of the assignments from COMP 20. 

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
- My favorite assignment was Assignment 2 because I think I learned the most. I was frustrated because I had a difficult asynchronous issue and had a very hard time fixing it but it showed real world implications and applications of what we were learning. 

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
- A fair amount. I wish I had put more time into the assignments instead of relying on quick answers. I definitely know a lot more than I used to.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
- asynchronous programming and the significance of this and how to fix problems it may cause when coding
- Git control and working on the same code with groups of people

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
- I really like Databases and server side. Hopefully I can take that class within the next year.
