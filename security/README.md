Assignment 4
By Madeline Payne
26 April 2017

I have correctly implemented all the requirements. Im a little concerned about the third issue but based on talking to the TAs and others I am not sure what I could have put as a third issue because I could not do the injections that everyone else was doing because the passengers and vehicles were whitelisted.

I collaborated with Adam Plumer. (!!!!!!)

I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
