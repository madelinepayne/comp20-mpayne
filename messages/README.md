JQuery Lab
By: Madeline Payne
Date: 14/March/17


I have correctly implemented the requirements, keeping the caveats in mind.

I collaborated with my dad who showed me why my original solution was stupid.
He showed me how to clean it up and use the built in 'each' rather than the 
jquery each.

I spent ~2 hours on this.
