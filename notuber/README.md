I have correctly implemented all 6 requirements.

Help from: 
- Nika Wakulich Korchok helped me understand how to use markers. 
- Gen Silverman helped me figure out how to use console.log to debug.
- My dad helped me understand what my issue was with asynchronicity because the 
answer I got on Piazza was not helpful at all. 

I spent 8 hours on this.
